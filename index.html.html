<h2>What is cyber security</h2>
<p>
Cyber security is how individuals and organisations reduce the risk of cyber attack.
Cyber security's core function is to protect the devices we all use 
(smartphones, laptops, tablets and computers), and the services we access - both online 
and at work - from theft or damage.It's also about preventing unauthorised access to the vast 
amounts of personal information we store on these devices, and online.
</p>
<p>
Why is it important?
Cyber security is important because smartphones, computers and the internet are now such a 
fundamental part of modern life, that it's difficult to imagine how we'd function without them. 
From online banking and shopping, to email and social media, it's more important than ever to take 
steps that can prevent cyber criminals getting hold of our accounts, data, and devices.
world.

Malware
The term “malware” refers to malicious software variants—such as worms, viruses, Trojans, 
and spyware—that provide unauthorized access or cause damage to a computer. Malware attacks
 are increasingly “fileless” and designed to get around familiar detection methods, such as
 antivirus tools, that scan for malicious file attachments.

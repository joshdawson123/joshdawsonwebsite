<h2>The future of cyber security</h2>
<p>
As cyberattacks grow in volume and complexity, artificial intelligence (AI) is helping under-resourced security operations analysts stay ahead of threats. Curating threat intelligence from millions of 
research papers, blogs and news stories, AI technologies like machine learning and natural language processing provide rapid insights to cut through the noise of daily alerts, drastically reducing response 
times. Watch the video to see how AI helps analysts connect the dots between threats.

Over the course of the last decade, the world saw an uptick in state-run or state-sanctioned cyber-warfare. This trend began in 2010 with Stuxnet, a worm implanted on Iranian uranium centrifuge computers to trigger 
equipment failure. By 2017, Sandworm, a Russian-backed hacking group was boldly going after a broad range of targets, from American corporations to Eastern European energy grids.

Zero trust is a new name for an old concept: Don't assume that anything or anyone should be trusted. Verify the trustworthiness of each device, user, service or other entity before granting it access and frequently
reverify trustworthiness during access to ensure the entity hasn't been compromised. Give each entity access to onlythe resources it needs in order to minimize the impact of any violation of trust. Zero-trust principles can reduce the
 frequency of incidents and the severity of incidents that do occur.
